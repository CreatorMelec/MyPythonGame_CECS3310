# MyPythonGame_CECS3310

My name is Elimelec Rodriguez and this is my project that consists of a simple memory gaming using the library "graphics". 
The game "Remember the Shape" draws simple shapes on screen and then asks the player what shape was in one of the 4 squares, which are carefully labled as 1,2,3 and 4. 
Each time the player chooses to continue playing, the shapes are randomly drawn on screen inside one of the potential squares.
The question about each square changes randomly as well as rounds continue on.
